Description:
    Creates a lib file for acts_as_<polymorphic_interface> so that you do not need to repeat the 'has_many' and any additional methods for each class that is a <polymorphic_interface>.

Example:
    ./script/generate acts_as_polymorphic <polymorphic_interface> [association_name] [association_class_name] [dependency_style]

    This will create:
        lib/acts_as_<polymorphic_interface>.rb
        
        which will include a line like:

        has_many :<association_name>, :class_name => "<AssociationClassName",
                                      :as         => :<polymorphic_association>,
                                      :dependent  => :<dependency_style>
